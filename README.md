# Flex-Gallery

![demo1](img/divs_collapsed.PNG)

Image gallery created with CSS and JavaScript. 
The divs use flex to distribute themselves evenly. Upon clicking in a div, JavaScript toggles the 'open' class (increases font-size and flex-size). Once this transition ended, another function toggles the 'active' class, which hides/shows the first and last child of the div.
